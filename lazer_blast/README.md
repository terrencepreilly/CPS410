# Lazer Blast
"Lazer Blast" is an arcade style shooter (like
[Galaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga)), which includes
aspects of color matching and pattern matching.

## Game-play
The user pilots a small ship against hoards of enemies.  Each enemy
has a given color.  The player must use a similar-colored laser to
destroy that enemy.  For example, an enemy which is green much be
shot with a green laser.  A red laser will have no effect.  Waves of
enemies come in patterns: an astute fighter will be able to predict
the next wave from the previous, and will have a significant
advantage over the enemy.

Since the player cannot be expected to handle the copious masses
of colorful enemies immediately, the difficulty of the game increases
as the player progresses, starting with a single color and slowly
adding other colors and increasing the speed.
