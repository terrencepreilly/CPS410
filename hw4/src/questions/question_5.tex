    \subsubsection*{base\_classes.py}
        Base classes listed below implement the functionality common to
        actionable objects and rendered objects.  Most of our unit tests
        are concerned with these.
        \inputminted{python}{../assets/base_classes.py}

    \subsubsection*{driver.py}
        The driver file is a convenience for starting the program.  It
        runs the main menu.
        \inputminted{python}{../assets/driver.py}

    \subsubsection*{scenes.py}
        The scenes file contains the main menu and the game itself, our
        two main scenes.
        \inputminted{python}{../assets/scenes.py}

    \subsubsection*{settings.py}
        The settings file contains global settings we might like to change
        easily (or that users would like to change.)
        \inputminted{python}{../assets/settings.py}

    \subsubsection*{ships.py}
        The ships file contains the player and enemies.
        \inputminted{python}{../assets/ships.py}

    \subsubsection*{test\_abstracts.py}
        The \textit{test\_abstracts} file tests the assumptions underlying
        the base classes.  In particular, it ensures that the magic methods
        function.
        \inputminted{python}{../assets/test_abstracts.py}

    \subsubsection*{test\_ships.py}
        The \textit{test\_ships} file tests the player ship currently, and
        has some stubbed tests for enemies.  It currently tests player
        movement through the \textit{momentum} abstraction.
        \inputminted{python}{../assets/test_ships.py}
