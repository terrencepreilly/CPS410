    System architecture(2 minutes)
We show the the structure of our files, comment on our use of 
specific modules, and discuss what future additions could be made
to improve this project's system architecture in the future. 

    Unit testing(2 minutes)
We will show the source code of our unit tests, run them, then
discuss what future changes we could make to our unit tests in
order to improve them for future developers.

    Settings File(2 minutes)
We will show the source code for the settings file, explain
the function of each major portion, and discuss the possible
alternative file types we could use to improve the settings in
the future.

    Scenes(2 minutes)
We will explain our use of scenes to refactor the main game loop, 
show the source code and explain its main components, then
discuss how we might improve the implementation of this solution
in the future.

    Gameplay(2 minutes)
We will explain the premise of this game, the game mechanics involved,
and demonstrate the game's execution. Noteable gameplay elements will
include our use of lasers in place of projectile weapons, our decision
on keyboard layout, the assets used, and the color-matching.
