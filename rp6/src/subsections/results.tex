Our study successfully implemented enemies of multiple
colors, which could be destroyed by the player's laser
(given that it is of the same color.)  The rendering of
colors were greatly facilitated by the
\mintinline{python}{render()} methods of the
\mintinline{python}{Actor} class and \mintinline{python}{Enemy}
class.  Furthermore, the use of pygame's \mintinline{python}{Rect}
class made collisions very easy to detect.

The modularity of our menus also made the development of
extra features very quick.  The score board, for example,
was developed several days before the presentation.  But,
because the menus shared a common interface, and were
loosely coupled, it was easy to add it into the main menu.

We made liberal use of python's \mintinline{python}{__next__}
method for rendering.  We were able to successfully implement
rendering of images based on these magic methods.
