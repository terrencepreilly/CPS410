% Chapter 5	Performance Description
Most aspects of this game should feel instantaneous.  In a worst
case scenario, the initial loading of the game, or loading the game
from the menu, may take one or two seconds. (Simply to start the
interpreter.)  This, unfortunately, is a problem with Python itself,
since it must parse each included source file in order to load the game.
We will attempt to minimize these performance issues by not including
extraneous libraries.

Python also has so-called "stop-the-world" garbage collection moments.
Thankfully, these are far less frequent than in many other languages.
Since the amount of objects being allocated is relatively small (even
after a long game), this should not be a problem.  We will attempt
to mitigate this by not abusing large classes in commonly used entities.

The normal game-play aspects of the game should feel no lag, as there is
no intensive computation taking place.  For the user to be able to
focus on those few enemies with a certain color, we cannot crowd the
screen too much.  So, the computer will have few entities to deal with.

There will be no computationally expensive operations, such as path-finding.
The enemies, at least in the first release, will simply target the player
directly.
