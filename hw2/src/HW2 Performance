Performance Description:
The goal of this software is simply to entertain. The game will be based off of shoot-em-ups like Galaga or other arcade platforms, but bring this functionality to PC with our own twist. It will feature a menu system that is simple to operate and functional, characters that move on the screen, including the player ship, enemies, and obstacles that may be affected by weapons in different ways. We are also implementing a slight twist by adding a mechanic of color-coded weapons to change the difficulty and player experience.
