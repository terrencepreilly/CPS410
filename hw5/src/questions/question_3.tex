The base classes had to be updated in two ways for this phase: a \mintinline{python}{move} method had to be implemented, and bounds checking (through a method called \mintinline{python}{in_bounds}) had to be implemented.  The latter allowed the former to be more manageable.  This was done in the base classes because it is a common function to both enemies and players.  Testing was done through unit tests.
