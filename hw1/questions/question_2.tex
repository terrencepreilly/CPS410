% EXAMPLE
% 2.  Scenarios
% Using the dynamic registration form application, the event
% organizer can select the information fields that correspond with
% the desired data to be collected. The user will be given ability
% to create custom questions in the case that additional,
% non-standardized data is desired. Also, mechanisms will be put in
% place to allow payments to be processed through the University's
% QuickPay system. A system must exist to notify organizer of new
% registrations, and allow for registrant confirmation. In addition,
% the user will be able to edit registrant information and update
% offline payment information via an administrative
% panel.
Downloading the game, the user can navigate through the menu to
begin a new game, view statistics, and adjust settings.  If the
user begins a new game, they are dropped in a scene and immediately
are accosted by white enemies.  The user's weapon can fire white
lasers.  Once the user has dispatched the enemies, a new swarm arrives.
These enemies, though, may be of a different color, or may be
mixed with the previous color.  The user will have to switch
between colors to dispatch like-colored enemies.  From time to time,
the user may find a power-up that will help them to live longer.
