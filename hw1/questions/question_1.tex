% EXAMPLE
% 1.  Problem Domain
% The Office of Information Technology provides, among other
% services, the service of creating registration forms for events
% such as conferences. This form collects information about the
% registrant, provides a mechanism to collect a fee for such
% registration, and gives the organizer a way to manage the booking
% list (editing information, updating payments, etc.). Creating a
% new form for each new event is time consuming, and prevents OIT
% resources from committing time to more non-trivial projects.
% Therefore, OIT would like to have a web application developed that
% can automate the majority of this process to free up developer
% time.
